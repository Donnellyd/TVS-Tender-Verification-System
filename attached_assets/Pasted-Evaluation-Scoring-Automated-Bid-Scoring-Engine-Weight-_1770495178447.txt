Evaluation & Scoring

Automated Bid Scoring Engine - Weight-based scoring system where admins define criteria (price, experience, compliance, BBBEE level, etc.) and the system auto-scores submissions
Comparative Bid Analysis Dashboard - Side-by-side comparison of vendor bids with visual charts showing strengths/weaknesses
Vendor Experience

Document Expiry Alerts - Notify vendors via WhatsApp/email when their compliance documents are about to expire
Bid Status Timeline - Visual timeline showing vendors exactly where their submission is in the evaluation process
Admin & Operations

Evaluation Committee Module - Assign multiple evaluators to a tender, collect independent scores, and aggregate results with conflict resolution
Tender Calendar - Visual calendar view of all open/closing/upcoming tenders with deadline reminders
Custom Report Builder - Generate PDF reports for audit purposes (evaluation summaries, compliance reports, award justifications)
Communication

Automated Notification Workflows - Trigger sequences like: tender published → notify qualified vendors → submission deadline reminder → evaluation complete → award notification
Vendor Q&A / Clarification System - Structured Q&A where vendors ask questions about tenders and admins respond (visible to all bidders for transparency)
