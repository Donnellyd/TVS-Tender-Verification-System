Here’s a SA-specific version of the Tender Vetting and Verification System (TVS) functional specification. It focuses on South Africa’s procurement landscape, aligned with PFMA/MFMA, BBBEE, CSD, POPIA, SAQA, and local government practices. The structure is designed to be dropped into an RFP or BRD and then expanded into detailed design documents.

1) Executive summary (SA-focused)
- Purpose: Build a Tender Vetting and Verification System (TVS) to automate and standardise tender intake, vendor verification, compliance checks, and audit trails within South African municipalities.
- Scope: Vendor registration, tender intake, document verification, SA-specific compliance checks (CSD, VAT, SAQA/NSDS alignment where relevant, BBBEE, debarment), risk scoring, retakes/clarifications, module-level checks, mock evaluations for internal governance, analytics, and reporting.
- Audience: Municipal procurement officers, contract managers, compliance auditors, internal audit, and external vendors.
- Compliance and governance: Designed to comply with POPIA, PFMA/MFMA, BBBEE, SAQA, and NSDS requirements; data residency and privacy controls aligned to SA policy.

2) Key SA constraints and considerations
- Regulatory landscape: PFMA (National Treasury framework for public procurement), MFMA (municipal finance management) at local government level; PPPFA (Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act) and BBBEE requirements for preference points.
- Verification sources: Central Supplier Database (CSD), SAQA/NQF alignment for qualifications, VAT status via SARS, tax clearance, company registration (CIPC), debarment lists (national and provincial), and local content requirements where applicable.
- Data governance: POPIA compliance for all personal and vendor data; explicit data retention timelines; audit-ready logs.
- Local adoption: Multi-tenant design for multiple municipalities with strict data segregation; potentially different procurement rules per municipality.

3) Stakeholders (SA context)
- Municipal procurement officers and contract managers
- Compliance and internal audit teams (PFMA/MFMA audits)
- Legal/commercial teams
- Vendors/suppliers bidding for municipal tenders
- IT/security teams (data sovereignty and security)
- SAQA/NSDS alignment officers (where relevant to tenders)

4) Functional requirements (core capabilities) – SA-aligned
4.1 User management and access
- Roles: Admin, Procurement Officer, Compliance Officer, Reviewer/Auditor, Vendor (supplier portal), System Integrator.
- Access control: RBAC with per‑municipality data boundaries.
- Authentication: Support for SSO (e.g., Azure AD) plus MFA; local accounts as fallback if required.
- Audit trails: Immutable logs of user actions (view, upload, approve, reject, export).

4.2 Vendor registration and management
- Vendor self-registration with validation steps (company name, VAT number, CSD ID, physical address, contact details).
- Data validation: cross-check against CSD; de-duplication; merge and standardise records.
- Status tracking: Approved, Pending, Suspended, Debarred.
- Document repository: store registration documents (VAT certificate, tax clearance, BBBEE certificate, company registration, health/safety certificates, etc.).

4.3 Tender intake and normalization
- Intake channels: web portal for tenders, email ingestion, or integration with existing e-procurement systems.
- Document handling: OCR for scanned docs, metadata extraction, document-type classification.
- Data normalization: standard fields (tender number, issuer, closing date, RFQ/RFP/RFT types, etc.).

4.4 Compliance checks and rules engine (SA-focused)
- Core checks (configurable per municipality):
  - Vendor identity and legal status (CSD presence, active status with CIPC)
  - Tax/VAT status (VAT registration, SARS status, tax clearance validity)
  - Debarment status (central and local debarment lists where available)
  - BBBEE status (certificate validity; threshold requirements per tender type)
  - Local content requirements (evidence where applicable)
  - Licences/permits relevant to tender scope (safety, health, environmental permits)
  - POPIA considerations for data handling
- Enhanced checks (configurable):
  - Consistency across documents (name matches registration, VAT ID alignment)
  - Duplicate tender detection (prevent repeated submissions)
  - Performance indicators from historical data (if available)
  - Data integrity validations (hashes, timestamps, versioning)
- Scoring and decisioning:
  - Rule-based scoring per check; configurable thresholds by tender type/municipality.
  - Auto-flag for manual review when risk thresholds are breached.
- Compliance alignment:
  - Ensure alignment with PFMA/MFMA procurement processes; traceability for audits.

4.5 Document verification and management
- Versioned document storage with metadata, expiry, and provenance.
- Verification workflows: automated checks plus human review; status markers (verified, pending, rejected).
- Digital signatures where applicable; tamper-evident audit trails.

4.6 Workflow, approvals, and governance
- Intake workflow: submission -> automated checks -> manual review -> decision/notification.
- Escalation paths: procurement lead, legal, compliance, or internal audit.
- Status tracking: in-progress, under-review, approved, rejected, on-hold.
- SLA alignment per municipality and per tender category.

4.7 Notifications and communications
- Stakeholder notifications for new tenders, required actions, review reminders, and outcomes.
- Preferences: email, SMS, in-app notifications.

4.8 Analytics, dashboards, and reporting
- Operational dashboards: tender intake volumes, status distribution, time-to-decision.
- Compliance dashboards: pass rates, common failure reasons, processing times by municipality.
- Audit-ready reports: per-tender audit trail, document version history, reviewer actions.
- KPI examples: time-to-first decision, pass rate by category, debarment rate, vendor registration turnaround time.
- Data export: CSV/Excel/PDF with filters for governance and audits.
- Data retention: configurable per data type and compliance needs.

4.9 Security and privacy
- POPIA-compliant data handling; RBAC, encryption at rest/in transit; MFA for admins.
- Data residency: SA-resident data preferred; define cross-border data flows clearly.
- Auditability: immutable logs, tamper-evident records where feasible.
- Incident response: defined plan for data breaches or policy violations.

4.10 Integrations and APIs
- RESTful APIs for ingestion, verification, and results retrieval.
- Integration points with CSD, SAQA/BBBEE databases, SARS VAT/tax status, and CIPC for company status.
- Webhooks for real-time events (new tender, status change, approvals).
- Data exchange formats: JSON/XML; support for CSV exports for governance.

4.11 Data migration and content import
- Plan to migrate legacy tender and vendor data; mapping to TVS schema.
- Data cleansing, deduplication, and validation steps for migration.

5) Non-functional requirements
- Performance and scalability: handle peak tender cycles; scalable storage/compute.
- Availability: target 99.5%+; robust disaster recovery.
- Security: SOC 2/ISO-like controls; secure SDLC; regular testing.
- Compliance: POPIA; retention schedules; audit readiness.

7) MVP and phased rollout (SA)
- Phase 1: Core intake, basic vendor verification (CSD, VAT, tax clearance, debarment), and simple dashboards.
- Phase 2: Integrations with SA sources (BBBEE, VAT, CSD), automated scoring, enhanced document checks, and notifications.
- Phase 3: Advanced analytics, audit trails, API exposure, and procurement-system integration.
- Phase 4: Full automation, multi-municipality governance, and predictive indicators.

8) Governance, privacy, and compliance (SA)
- POPIA: ensure data minimisation, consent (where required), access controls, and retention policies.
- PFMA/MFMA: procurement governance; auditable workflows and approvals.
- BBBEE/SAQA: ensure data fields support verification and reporting for compliance and alignment where relevant.
- Data residency: prefer SA-hosted data; document any cross-border usage and controls.
- Third-party data: verify the reliability of external data sources (CSD, BBBEE, VAT) and maintain fallback/manual review.

9) Implementation plan and next steps
- Step 1: Confirm scope and hosting preference (SA-resident cloud vs hybrid).
- Step 2: Identify data sources (CSD, SAQA, BBBEE, SARS, CIPC) and establish data-sharing arrangements.
- Step 3: Define MVP scope, milestones, and resource plan (PM, BA, developers, QA, security).
- Step 4: Select technology stack (cloud provider, database, ETL/ELT tools, BI platform).
- Step 5: Prototyping: build vendor onboarding, tender intake, and basic compliance checks.
- Step 6: Pilot with 1–2 municipalities; gather feedback and iterate.
- Step 7: Scale to additional municipalities; implement governance and reporting templates.
- Step 8: Continuous improvement: expand checks, improve analytics, and refine dashboards.

If you’d like, I can tailor this SA-focused TVS spec to a particular municipality, sector (water, housing, transport, etc.), or a specific technology stack. I can also produce a formal Word or PDF version, with a detailed project plan, a data dictionary tailored to SA sources, and a backlog of user stories and acceptance criteria. Tell me your target municipality(s), preferred cloud and BI tools, and your MVP/rollout dates, and I’ll prepare the final documents.
