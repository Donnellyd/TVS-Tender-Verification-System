1. Geolocation Tracking

Store GPS coordinates for key actions like:

Learner registration (where they enrolled from)
Attendance check-ins (prove they're physically at the training site)
Stipend collection confirmations
Provider site visits by auditors
This helps detect patterns like a learner supposedly attending training in Johannesburg but registering from Cape Town, or 50 learners all "attending" from the same residential address instead of the training facility.

2. Ghost Student / Fraud Prevention

Several layers would help here:

ID number validation — South African ID numbers have a built-in checksum (Luhn algorithm). We can validate the format and check digit immediately on input.
Duplicate detection — Flag when the same ID number, phone number, or email appears across multiple enrollments or providers.
Attendance anomaly detection — Flag learners with suspiciously perfect attendance or zero attendance, or providers where all learners have identical attendance patterns.
Cross-reference checks — Compare learner lists across providers to catch individuals enrolled in multiple programmes simultaneously.
Risk scoring — Automatically calculate a fraud risk score based on multiple signals (geolocation mismatch, attendance patterns, provider history).
3. Photo Verification / Selfie Check

This would work as a two-step process:

At registration — Learner takes a selfie that gets stored with their profile alongside their ID document photo.
At attendance — Learner takes a selfie check-in. The system compares it against their registration photo to confirm identity.
Liveness detection — Require a specific action (blink, turn head) to prevent someone holding up a printed photo.
For implementation, this would need a facial recognition API service (like AWS Rekognition, Azure Face API, or a South African provider). The selfie comparison would happen server-side.

4. Department of Home Affairs Integration

This is critical for verifying that:

The ID number belongs to a real person
The name matches what was provided
The person is alive (not deceased)
Age verification (for youth programmes)
The DHA has an API through the National Population Register. Integration would typically go through an approved verification service provider (like XDS, Experian SA, or Home Affairs' own e-Verification system). We'd build the integration point and call their API during learner registration.

5. Additional Suggestions

Digital signatures — Require learners to digitally sign attendance registers, making it harder for providers to fabricate records.
SMS/OTP verification — Send a one-time code to the learner's registered phone number during key actions (registration, stipend claim) to confirm identity.
Provider audit scoring — Track provider compliance history and automatically flag high-risk providers for more frequent audits.
Biometric attendance — Fingerprint scanning at training sites as an alternative to selfie check-ins.
Whistleblower portal — Anonymous reporting mechanism for suspected fraud.
Blockchain audit trail — Immutable record of all transactions and approvals that can't be tampered with after the fact.
What I can build right now:

SA ID number validation with Luhn checksum
Geolocation capture on key forms (registration, attendance)
Duplicate detection and fraud risk scoring
The integration point/interface for DHA verification (the actual API connection would need credentials from an approved provider)
Photo upload fields for selfie verification (the facial comparison would need an external AI service)
