Help System Implementation Prompt
Use this prompt to instruct an AI agent to create a comprehensive help system for any Replit application.

Prompt
Create a comprehensive integrated help system for this application with the following components:
### 1. HelpManual Component
Create a `HelpManual` component that displays context-sensitive help in a slide-out Sheet panel. It should include:
- **Guide tab**: Overview sections explaining the module's purpose and features
- **Quick Start tab**: Numbered step-by-step instructions to get started
- **FAQ tab**: Common questions and answers in an accordion
- **Tips tab**: Best practices and pro tips
The component should:
- Accept a `moduleId` prop to load the appropriate help content
- Use a Sheet component that slides in from the right
- Include tabs for Guide, Quick Start, FAQ, and Tips
- Show related modules as clickable badges
### 2. Help Content File
Create a `helpContent.ts` file in `lib/` that exports help content for each module. Each module should have:
```typescript
interface ModuleHelp {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  sections: Array<{ title: string; content: string }>;
  faqs: Array<{ question: string; answer: string }>;
  quickStart: Array<{ step: number; title: string; description: string }>;
  bestPractices: string[];
  relatedModules?: string[];
}
Create content for every page/module in the application covering:

What the module does
Key features and capabilities
Common workflows
At least 3-5 FAQs per module
4-5 quick start steps
3-5 best practices
3. FieldHelp Component
Create a FieldHelp component for form field tooltips:

Small info icon (HelpCircle) next to field labels
Popover on click showing field explanation
Props: fieldId and content (or lookup from a fieldHelp object)
Use this for complex fields like:

Financial calculations (depreciation, residual value)
Date fields with specific requirements
Fields with business rules or constraints
4. StatusBadgeHelp Component
Create a StatusBadgeHelp component that replaces regular status badges:

Clickable badge that shows a popover with status explanation
Props: status (the status value), type (category like "asset", "workOrder", "transfer")
Define status definitions for each type with label and description
Auto-detect badge variant based on status (success, warning, destructive)
5. GlobalHelpSearch Component
Create a global help search using Command/CommandPalette pattern:

Trigger with Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut
Search across all help content (titles, FAQs, sections)
Show categorized results
Click to open the relevant help module
6. KeyboardShortcuts Component
Create a dialog showing all keyboard shortcuts:

Trigger with Ctrl+/ (or Ctrl+?)
Display shortcuts in a grid/table format
Include shortcuts for: Help search, shortcuts dialog, navigation
7. GuidedTour Component
Create a first-time user walkthrough:

Highlight key UI elements with tooltips
Step through main features
Store completion state in localStorage
Include skip and restart options
8. Integration Requirements
Add HelpManual button to every page header (PageHeader component)
Add GlobalHelpSearch to the app header
Add KeyboardShortcuts trigger to the app
Add StatusBadgeHelp to all status columns in data tables
Add FieldHelp to complex form fields
Trigger GuidedTour on first visit
9. Keyboard Shortcuts to Implement
Ctrl+K: Open global help search
Ctrl+/ or Ctrl+?: Open keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl+H: Open current page help (optional)
Escape: Close any open help modal/sheet
10. Styling Guidelines
Use existing UI components (Sheet, Dialog, Popover, Tabs, Accordion)
Help button should be clearly labeled "Help" not just an icon
Use consistent iconography (HelpCircle, Book, Lightbulb, etc.)
Ensure all help panels are scrollable for long content
